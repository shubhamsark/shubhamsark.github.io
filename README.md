# Programming Series

## Introduction

This series of notes is to capture all the learnings, exercises, discussions that I come across related to Programming. Let's dive deeper in the world of Data Structures and Algorithms, Parallel Programming, Object Oriented Programming and Systems. The magnitude of learning deepens once you try explaining it to others, I've chosen this platform to do just that. So, let's try to come up with elegant solution and excite ourselves with the unlimited potential of how coding is changing the world one bit at a time.
