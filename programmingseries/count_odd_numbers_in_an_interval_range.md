# Programming Series

In continuation to our exploration, let's start with a very simple problem which could be solved by looking at it from a different perspective.

## Solution Approaches

### Approach 1:

The simple solution that comes to mind first would be to loop through from `low` to `high` and check which numbers yields 1 when divided by 2 â†’ 

- **Note:** If the modulo operator yields 1, in that case the number is odd and should be counted.

A simple code should be able to do this for us, eh?

Too simple? Whereâ€™s the catch? Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) -

Letâ€™s see why this happened. This would take `O(n)` travelling from left to right and checking if each number is odd or not. So, if the input values from `low = 0` and `high = 100000000` or `10^9`. This would lead to looping through a very large set of input and the checker would give up.

Whatâ€™s a better way to go about solving this problem? Letâ€™s go outsmart the TLE!

### Approach 2:

Letâ€™s concentrate on the fact that in a given range, there will be almost half odd numbers. Letâ€™s take care of the corner cases with this thought in mind. What are the possible scenarios?

**Scenario 1:** `[even, even] â†’ [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, by using high level of human intelligence we can clearly see that between `2 and 6` there will be `2` odd numbers. 

**Scenario 2:** `[even, odd] â†’ [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, again summoning our intelligence we can say that there will be `3` odd numbers in this range.

**Scenario 3:** `[odd, even] â†’ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, calling up our super brain capability we can count that there will be `3` odd numbers in this range.

**Scenario 4:** `[odd, odd] â†’ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, câ€™mon this should be no brainer now ðŸ˜› there are `3` odd numbers.

What can we conclude from this?

**From Scenario 1:** If the numbers are even then we can simply take the difference and divide it by 2 â†’ `(high - low)/2`  to get the odd numbers count in between.

Extrapolating on the previously presented Scenario: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` â†’ `(8-2)/2 = 3`

**From Scenario 2-4:** If any one of the numbers are odd, there will be 1 extra number always classified as odd. Hence, `(high-low)/2 + 1`. 

**Note:** treating the division to be of integer numbers yielding an integer as a result

`[even, odd] â†’ [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` â†’ `(7-2)/2 + 1 = 3`

`[odd, even] â†’ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` â†’ `(6-1)/2 + 1 = 3`

`[odd, odd] â†’ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` â†’ `(5-1)/2 + 1 = 3`

In this we did not have to loop around the numbers to find the result, just a basic subtraction, division and addition of the numbers already available to us would be enough to sail through. A simple realisation at times takes us places, eh? Letâ€™s code it up!
